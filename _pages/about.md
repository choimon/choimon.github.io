### Welcome! I'm Minjeong Choi&nbsp; ðŸ™Œ.

I am a web developer in Seoul, Korea. \
I'm currently working as a front-end developer, but I used to work as a back-end developer in my first company. 

My current tech interests are cloud and Vue.js. \
My dream is to build an app that would greatly help people and give more value to the world (with lots of traffic ðŸ˜†).

Besides tech stuff, I love to do boxing in my freetime. ðŸ¥Š \
I also love learning other new things - places, people, food, life, art, music, and animals!

I love to share my knowledge with people and also learn from them!

I'm planning to write posts both in Korean and English.
Korean because yes, I'm Korean! I'm planning to write in English as well because I believe English posts would globally reach more people. \
If you find posts that are in Korean, but want to know about them in English, just let me know!

Please feel free to leave comments, follow me on Github, or make a connection on LinkedIn!\
Lastly, I'll off my cutest dog í† ë¦¬ (Tori):
