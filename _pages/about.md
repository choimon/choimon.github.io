### Welcome! I'm Minjeong Choi.

I am a web developer currently looking for a back-end position.

My current tech interests are Java and Spring Boot.\
My dream is to build an app that would help people and give more value to the world (with lots of traffic).

Of course, I love to learn about new technology, but I'm also interested in learning other new things - about people, life, art, music, animals, and everything! \
(side note: I studied math and economics in college.)

I love to share my knowledge with people and also learn from them!

I'm planning to write posts both in Korean and English.
Korean because yes, I'm Korean! I'm choosing English as well because I believe English posts would globally reach more people.
If you find posts that are in Korean, but want to know about them in English, just let me know!

Please feel free to leave comments, follow me on Github, or make a connection on LinkedIn!

Lastly, I'll show off my cutest dog 토리 (Tori):
