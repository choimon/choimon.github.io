# Summary 
In this post, I will cover the basics of Object Oriented Programming(OOP). 

## Definition 
OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects or data instead of functions and logic. An object is a "data field that has unique attributes and behavior."[^fn1] This concept is used to design a software program with simple, reusable pieces of code-classes.

It is the most popular programming paradigm today. OOP programming languages include Java, C++, Python, and Javascript. 

### Building blocks 
- Classes
  - an "abstract blueprint used to create more specific concrete objects"[^fn2]. 
- Objects
- Methods
  - distinct logic sequence
- Attributes


## 4 principles of OOP 
- Encapsulation
  - The manipulation and state of an object are privately defined inside a class. Other objects cannot directly access and change this class
  - ex) private fields' get, set methods
  - adds security and avoids unintended data corruption
- Abstraction
  - hide unnecessary implementation code
  - easy to make changes over time 
- Inheritance
  - assign relationships between objects 
  - developers can reuse a common logic with a uniue hierarchy 
- Polymorphism
  - objects can take more than one form
  - different classes use the same interface and have their own implementation
  - ex) overloading a method with different parameter sets (static polymorphism),  a subclass' overriding its superclass' method (dynamic polymorphism)[^fn3]

## SOLID principles of OOP Design
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - each component should have only one responsibility 
- Open Closed Principle (OCP)
  - open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - an object of a child class is able to replace an object of its base class
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - a class should not be forced to implement members that it does not need/use
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  -  high-level (fundamental logic) components should not depend on low-level (specific logic) components[^fn4]

## characteristics 
+
- code reusability 
- scalability
